# CaulfieldSync

**CaulfieldSync** is a wrapper for the [CaulfieldLife](https://caulfieldlife.com.au) API.

It was created from a growing need for a better way to interact with CaulfieldLife, namely to create third party utilities that would make the experience of using the app better.

You can view the documentation for the project here: https://caulfieldsync-docs.vercel.app
